## 🎯 INVESTMENT SCENARIOS EXPLAINED

### What Are Investment Scenarios?
Scenarios are "what-if" financial projections that show how different life events, market conditions, or decisions impact your investment goals.

### 🎪 Example Scenarios (Premium Feature)

#### Life Event Scenarios
```
BASE CASE: Current plan (5% investment, 15% returns, 15 years)
→ Result: $2.5M portfolio

SCENARIO A: "What if I lose my job for 6 months?"
→ Pause investments for 6 months, resume after
→ Result: $2.2M portfolio (-$300k impact)
→ AI Suggestion: "Build 6-month emergency fund first"

SCENARIO B: "What if I get a 30% raise next year?"
→ Increase investment rate to 8% of income
→ Result: $3.1M portfolio (+$600k impact)
→ AI Suggestion: "Maximize 401k match immediately"

SCENARIO C: "What if I buy a house and reduce investments?"
→ Reduce investment to 3% for 5 years, then back to 5%
→ Result: $2.0M portfolio (-$500k impact)
→ AI Suggestion: "Consider house down payment vs investment ROI"
```

#### Market Condition Scenarios
```
BASE CASE: 15% annual returns (optimistic)
→ Result: $2.5M portfolio

CONSERVATIVE: 8% annual returns (realistic)
→ Result: $1.8M portfolio
→ AI Suggestion: "Increase savings rate to 7% to maintain goals"

RECESSION: Market crashes 40% in year 5, recovers slowly
→ Result: $1.9M portfolio
→ AI Suggestion: "Continue investing during downturn for better returns"

INFLATION: High inflation reduces real returns to 5%
→ Result: $1.4M portfolio (purchasing power)
→ AI Suggestion: "Consider inflation-protected securities (TIPS)"
```

#### Strategy Scenarios
```
SCENARIO A: "Aggressive early, conservative later"
→ 20% returns for 10 years, then 8% for 5 years
→ Result: $2.8M portfolio
→ AI Suggestion: "Optimal for your age and risk tolerance"

SCENARIO B: "Dollar-cost averaging vs lump sum"
→ Compare monthly investments vs annual lump sum
→ Show timing impact on returns
→ AI Suggestion: "DCA reduces risk, lump sum maximizes returns"

SCENARIO C: "Different investment percentages"
→ 3% vs 5% vs 10% of income comparison
→ Show compound effect of higher savings rate
→ AI Suggestion: "Each 1% increase = 3 years earlier retirement"
```
